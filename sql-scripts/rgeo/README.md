# rgeo - Reverse Geocoder

The real gems in here are:

```
imt-rgeo-pgis-2.0.sql
imt-rgeo-pgis-2.0-part2.sql
```

These prepare data and install a very high performance reverse geocoder into a postgresql database. There are tools elsewhere in this repository that will prepare and load street/road data from Tiger for the US, StatCan or GeoBase for Canada, and Navteq/HERE data to work with the reverse geocoder.
