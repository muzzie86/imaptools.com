shp2tile CHANGES
-------------------------------
version 1.14, 2006-05-30 woodbri
- merged changes by Daniel Morissette to add the --maxdepth option to the
  --quadtree option.

version 1.13, 2005-12-05 woodbri
- added -v and --version command line switches to print the cvs version
  string so people can identify what version it is. Hence the change in
  version number from 1.4 to 1.13.

version 1.4, 2005-07-19 woodbri
- Fixed a bug where we deleted files that we abort tiling on.

version 1.3, 2005-07-19 woodbri
- Added CHANGES file to distribution
- Fixed a quadtree bug that was caused by points being stacked
  up at a single location that exceeded the quadtree count. This
  cause the software to do a divide by zero and generally fail
  in other horrible ways. This and a related cases are now 
  detected and further division of the file or subfile is halted
  while the rest of the files are still processed.
